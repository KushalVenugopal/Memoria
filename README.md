# Memoria

Memoria - A Design Computing Studio - Build project

In this project, we aimed at developing a hardware + software product, which enables users to be mindful of their surroundings when outside, while also recording memories and data and curating them for the users.

The main aim of the project was to get users to go old school, and be mindful of their surroundings, while creating fun memories.

The hardware was designed to record Audio and the Location of the users when they are out and about.
The software was designed to collect said data, and curate it for the users in the form of memories.

I particularly worked on the Hardware side of and the Kickstarter-Style video for the project.

The tools we used in the Hardware side:

- Arduino Uno - coded using C++
- GPS Module
- Microphone
- SD Card Module
- LEDs
- Switches
- Batteries

The schematic circuit design is shown in the Fritzing file attached (Memoria.fzz).
I coded the Arudino Uno in C++ and the .ino file is attached.

As for the Kickstarter-Style video, I did the following:

- Script and Screenplay writing
- Location Recee and finalisation
- Direction
- Cinematography
- Editing

The editing was done using Adobe Premier Pro.
The link to the video is in the file named kickstarter_video.txt

The software side of the project was done using Reactjs. + Node.js
